# Tenis


Write a program that shows how a tennis game goes and who won it.
The program will receive a sequence consisting of "P1" (Player 1) or "P2" (Player 2), depending on who
win every point of the game.

- The scores of a game are "Love" (zero), 15, 30, 40, "Deuce" (tie), advantage.
- Given the sequence [P1, P1, P2, P2, P1, P2, P1, P1], the program would display the following:
15 - Love
30 - Love
30 - 15
30 - 30
40 - 30
Two
P1 advantage
He has won P1
 - If you want, you can control errors in data entry.
 - Consult the game rules if you have questions about the points system.
